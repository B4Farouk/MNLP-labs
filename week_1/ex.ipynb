        "## Intro - Word embedding models\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔵 What?\n",
        "A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. It is this approach to representing words and documents that may be considered one of the key breakthroughs of deep learning on challenging natural language processing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🟡 How?\n",
        "There are different versions of word embeddings depending on the way the embeddings are learned.\n",
        "- Some of the models learn a focus word given the neighboring words that surround them (like word2vec: CBOW).\n",
        "- Some other models learn the neighboring words given the focus word (word2vec: skip-gram).\n",
        "- Some other words embedding models try to derive the relationship between the words from global statistics of the words in the overall corpus (like GloVe).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🟣 Why?\n",
        "Word embedding in NLP is an important term that is used for representing words for text analysis in the form of real-valued vectors. It is an advancement in NLP that has improved the ability of computers to understand text-based content in a better way. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A little bit of history on word embeddings\n",
        "In 2013, Tomas Mikolov et al. developed an algorithm for learning word embeddings called **Word2vec** [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)][[code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)]. This algorithm uses a shallow neural network to learn word vectors so that each word of a given corpus is good at predicting its own contexts (Skip-Gram) or vice versa (CBOW).\n",
        "\n",
        "One year after the publication of Word2vec, Pennington et al. developed a new algorithm for learning word embeddings called **GloVe** [[paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)][[code](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe)]. This algorithm is based on the observation that word relationships can be recovered from the co-occurrence statistics of any (large enough) corpus."

This is the inspiration behind many algorithms for learning numerical representations of words (word embeddings). An important aspect of these representations is the ability to solve word analogies of the form “A is to B what C is to X” using simple arithmetic. This is generally simplified as “King — Man + Woman = Queen.\n",
